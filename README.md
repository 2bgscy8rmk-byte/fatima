# CS 370 Module Eight – Portfolio Reflection

## 1. Briefly Explain the Work That You Did on This Project

In this project, I designed and trained a **pirate intelligent agent** using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** within a custom Treasure Hunt Game environment. The starter code provided the maze structure (`TreasureMaze.py`) and experience-replay framework (`GameExperience.py`). I completed the missing code blocks in `TreasureHuntGame.ipynb`, implementing the **Q-network**, replay buffer sampling, epsilon-greedy action selection, and the full training loop. My algorithm enabled the pirate to learn through trial and error, using neural-network approximations of Q-values to find the optimal path to the treasure.

## 2. Connect Your Learning From This Course to the Larger Field of Computer Science

### What Do Computer Scientists Do and Why Does It Matter?

Computer scientists design and build intelligent systems that solve real-world problems efficiently and ethically. The techniques I used—reinforcement learning, neural networks, and algorithmic optimization—are foundational to innovations across healthcare, robotics, finance, and game design. Our work matters because AI systems increasingly shape how humans interact with technology and how decisions are made at scale.

### How Do I Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist?

I learned to approach problems systematically: define the environment, identify state and action spaces, set measurable goals, and choose appropriate algorithms. In this project, that meant breaking a vague idea (“teach a pirate to find treasure”) into a clear sequence of tasks: model design, data representation, training, and evaluation. I now see that effective computer-science work combines analytical rigor with experimentation and iteration.

### What Are My Ethical Responsibilities to the End User and the Organization?

Building intelligent systems brings responsibility to ensure fairness, transparency, and safety. As a developer, I must protect user data, document system limitations, and avoid unintended harm. In reinforcement learning especially, defining rewards carefully is crucial—poorly designed incentives can lead an agent to optimize for the wrong outcomes. Ethical diligence maintains trust between creators, organizations, and the people affected by our technology.

## 3. Summary Reflection

This project showed me how reinforcement learning can turn abstract algorithms into observable intelligent behavior. Watching the pirate agent evolve from random wandering to purposeful navigation was proof of how iterative learning and feedback loops drive AI success. The experience strengthened both my technical foundation in neural-network design and my understanding of the broader ethical and professional expectations of a computer scientist.
